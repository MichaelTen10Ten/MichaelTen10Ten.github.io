## The Crimson Dismissal

It was supposed to be the best day of the year. The final exam was over, the weight of the semester finally lifted, and the air smelled of freedom. But that relief vanished the moment I got home and realized my backpack was missing. I must have left it under my desk.

By the time I made it back to the school gates, the world had slipped into a heavy, unnatural darkness. It was nearly 8:00 PM.

I slipped inside. The corridors were hollow, swallowing the sound of my footsteps. Not a soul was in sight. I took the stairs two at a time, my heart hammering against my ribs—not out of fear, but out of habit. If the Vice Principal caught a student sneaking in this late, there’d be hell to pay.

I reached my classroom and fumbled through the dark until my hands brushed against the canvas of my bag. Relief washed over me for a split second, and then... the world shifted.

A thick, suffocating silence settled over the room—a silence so heavy it felt louder than noise. Outside the window, the silver moonlight curdled into a bruised, sickly arterial red. The crimson glow bled through the glass, stretching the shadows of the desks across the floor like skeletal, reaching claws.

"Hey, student... what are you still doing here so late?"

The voice drifted from the far end of the hallway, thin and ethereal. My blood ran cold. The Vice Principal? Impossible. He had been gone for hours.

I spun around to the front of the room. On the empty blackboard, invisible chalk began to screech against the slate, carving out twisted, jagged characters:

**[Time to Leave School]**

I didn't wait. I grabbed my bag and bolted for the exit, my breath coming in ragged gasps. But as I reached the stairwell, a crisp, new poster pinned to the wall caught the moonlight. It hadn't been there ten minutes ago.

> ### CAMPUS DISMISSAL RULES
> 
> 
> 1. **The Gathering:** Within 15 minutes of the first bell—and before the second bell tolls—you must report to the covered playground on the ground floor.
> 2. **The Silence:** Do not make any noise while traversing the stairwells.
> 3. **The Goal:** Have a productive day.
> 
> 

A single, low chime echoed through the hollow halls. It wasn't the bright, mechanical ring of a school bell; it sounded like a heavy iron tolling deep underground. *The fifteen minutes have started.*

I didn't think—I ran.

## The Fog and the Shadows

I tumbled down the final flight of stairs, reaching the ground floor with my lungs burning. My only thought was the front gate. I sprinted toward the exit, but as I reached the foyer, I skidded to a halt.

A wall of thick, swirling gray mist had swallowed the world outside. It pressed against the glass doors like a living thing, churning with an unnatural density. I pushed against the door, but it wouldn't budge—not because it was locked, but because the fog outside felt as solid as concrete.

There was no way out. Not yet.

"The covered playground..." I whispered, remembering the rule. But the path was obscured. I had to find another way or wait for the fog to lift. My only choice was to head back up and search for clues—or a way to break the seal.

I retreated to the first floor, my footsteps light and my breath held tight. As I rounded the corner toward the classrooms, a chill crept down my spine.

A **Shadow** stood there.

It wasn't a person. It was a silhouette carved out of pure darkness, darker than the unlit hallway. It stood perfectly still, its head tilted at an impossible angle as if listening for a heartbeat. My heart hammered against my ribs, but I froze, pressing my back against the lockers. After an eternity, the Shadow drifted into a wall and vanished.

I didn't wait for it to return. I slipped into the bike station. My hands trembled as I scavenged through the drawers. Amidst the scattered wires and half-finished projects, my fingers closed around two heavy brass rings, Assembly Hall Key and Staff Room Key.

If the Staff Room was any record of these "Rules" or a way to contact the outside world, it would be there. I crept down the hall, the keys heavy and cold in my pocket, and stood before the heavy oak door of the Staff Room.

The heavy brass key turned in the lock with a resounding *click*. I pushed the door open, expecting the familiar scent of coffee and old paper. Instead, I was met with a sight so absurd it was terrifying.

## The Faculty of Hollow Men

The Staff Room was not empty. At every single desk, a "teacher" sat with their back to the door, perfectly still.

I took a hesitant step forward, my skin crawling. As I got closer, the horror revealed its pathetic, grotesque nature. These weren't people. They were scarecrows built from school blazers and suits, propped up by jagged iron wires. In place of heads, nylon-covered basketballs rested on the collars. On each one, a teacher’s face had been scrawled in crude, childlike crayon—shaky eyes and jagged mouths that looked like a primary student’s nightmare.

I looked at the blackboard. In wet, crimson chalk, a message screamed across the slate:

> **"STUDENTS, DETENTION HAS BEGUN. PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS. NIGHT STUDY IS NOW IN SESSION."**

A rhythmic *crack... crack... crack...* filled the room. All at once, the basketball heads began to swivel. Their wire necks groaned as they turned 180 degrees to face me. The crude, scribbled faces began to leak dark, thick blood from their drawn eyes, the ink running down the nylon like tears.

My eyes darted to the teacher's lectern at the front of the room. There, resting under a paperweight, was a golden ticket: a School Departure Permit.

I didn't think. I bolted.

I lunged for the lectern, my sneakers squeaking against the linoleum. I snatched the permit, the paper crinkling in my fist, but as I turned to flee, a cold, metallic grip clamped around my ankle. One of the wire-frame "teachers" had slumped off its chair, its claw-like hand digging into my skin.

"Let go!" I screamed, swinging my free leg in a desperate arc. My heel connected with the basketball head, sending a spray of foul-smelling blood across the floor. The wire snapped, and the grip loosened.

I scrambled to my feet and tore out of the Staff Room, slamming the door behind me. I didn't look back to see if the clicking sounds were following me.

As I reached the balcony overlooking the ground floor, I stopped, gasping for air. The thick, concrete-like fog that had blocked the exit was gone. The courtyard lay bare under the bleeding red moon, the path to the front gate finally clear.

The permit in my hand felt like it was pulsing. It was time to get out of this twisted version of reality.

I was steps away from the gate, the path to freedom finally clear. But then, a flicker of light caught my eye from high above. Looking up, I saw a single computer monitor glowing in the darkness of the Assembly Hall’s upper balcony.

The blue light pulsed like a heartbeat, beckoning me. If I left now, I would never know the truth. Gritting my teeth, I turned back and raced up the stairs to the mezzanine.

## The Revelation

I reached the heavy double doors of the upper gallery. My hand trembled as I inserted the Assembly Hall Key. It turned smoothly, and the door creaked open to a room filled with dust motes dancing in the electronic glow.

The computer sat alone on a technician's desk. There were no wires connecting it to a power outlet, yet the screen was vivid, displaying a news archive dated from the previous year. My eyes scanned the scrolling text, and the air left my lungs.

> ### **LATEST NEWS: THE DOOMSDAY PROPHECY REALIZED**
> 
> 
> *Last July 5th, the largest earthquake and tsunami in recorded history struck the region between Japan and the Philippines. Researchers have confirmed the cause: The Moon has drifted from its orbit and is now in a state of terminal proximity to Earth.*
> *Elon Musk has accelerated the Mars Colonization Initiative, with the first wave of migration expected to begin within a year. Global governments have pledged to subsidize all low-income citizens to ensure the survival of the species.*
> *The Moon is projected to enter Earth’s atmosphere in eighteen months. Upon entry, atmospheric friction and gravitational tidal forces will cause the lunar surface to glow a deep, bruised crimson.*

The "School Departure Permit" felt cold in my hand. I looked out the window at the blood-red sky. This wasn't a ghost story. This wasn't a haunted school or a nightmare I could wake up from.

The red moonlight wasn't magic—it was the end of the world.

The silence of the school suddenly felt different. It wasn't the silence of a haunted building; it was the silence of a tomb for a civilization that was already running out of time. I wasn't just trying to go home; I was trying to survive a planet that was being crushed by its own moon.

I turned to leave the upper gallery, my mind reeling from the news of the apocalypse, but the shadows were faster.

## The Fog of Being

Just as I reached the stairwell, a hand made of cold wire and stiff fabric lunged from the dark. It was one of the "teachers" from the Staff Room. Its basketball head was dented, and the crude, bleeding eyes stared blankly as it pinned me against the railing. We grappled in the dim light of the computer screen—the mannequin’s grip was unnaturally strong, smelling of old nylon and wet ink. With a desperate surge of adrenaline, I slammed my elbow into its wire ribcage and twisted free, sprinting down the corridor as the "clack-clack-clack" of its wooden joints echoed behind me.

I ducked into the first heavy door I could find: **The Library.**

I slammed the door and locked it, leaning back to catch my breath. But the library had been transformed. The bookshelves had been pushed to the perimeter, and in the center of the room sat a massive, pulsating machine. It hummed with a low-frequency vibration that made my teeth ache.

Lying on a nearby table was a technical manual. I flipped through the pages, my eyes widening at the headers.

> ### **MANUAL: PHYSICAL ATOMIZATION TELEPORTATION DEVICE (PATD)**
> 
> 
> **The Theory:** Based on *Zeno’s Paradoxes*, this device utilizes *Focused Ion Beam (FIB) Technology* and *Nanotechnology* to transition physical matter into an atomized "mist" state while preserving its essential properties.
> **Transmission:** By applying *Superstring Theory* and *General Relativity*, the atomized state is teleported to a designated spatial coordinate.
> **Warning & Characteristics:** > * **Contagion:** Atomized matter will cause other physical entities it contacts to also atomize.
> * **Thermodynamics:** The mist state is unstable under heat; exposure to high temperatures will cause immediate and permanent evaporation.
> * **Biological Reaction:** When applied to protein-based organisms, the atomized mist will appear as a **dense, pitch-black shadow.**
> 
> 

I froze. *The Shadow.* The "Shadow" I had seen in the hallway wasn't a ghost. It was someone—or something—that had been processed by this machine. The black mist was the teachers. The black mist was the students.

I looked at the machine, then at the "Departure Permit" in my hand. This wasn't a school anymore. It was a laboratory for a desperate escape from a dying Earth, where "leaving" meant turning yourself into a cloud of black smoke and praying you didn't evaporate before you reached your destination.

The pieces of the puzzle were finally falling into place, but the picture they formed was far more sinister than a simple doomsday scenario. I stayed low, moving between the library shelves and slipping out the back door, successfully avoiding the rhythmic *clack-clack* of the mannequin searching for me in the aisles.

I navigated the darkened halls until I reached the **Activity Room**. Inside, the air was still and smelled of ozone. I approached a sleek workstation where a single document was pulled up on the screen—a draft for a speech.

## The Chairman’s Address

My eyes scanned the lines, and the chilling truth of the "School Rules" finally became clear.

> **SPEECH NOTES: STEAM OPEN DAY**
> *"As the Chairman of the Science Department, I would like to welcome you all to today’s STEAM Open Day. We are proud to announce a landmark partnership with a subsidiary of Tesla and SpaceX. Through this collaboration, we have acquired the first secretly developed 'Spatial-Temporal Atomization Unit.'*
> *Today, our students will have the unprecedented opportunity to experience the cutting-edge concepts of space and time firsthand. By stepping through the device, they will transcend the physical limits of our world..."*

I stepped back from the screen, my skin crawling. This wasn't a government evacuation plan. It was a high-stakes experiment disguised as a school showcase. The "End of the World" news I saw earlier—was it real, or was it just a simulated motivation to force the students into the machine?

The "Departure Permit" I held wasn't a ticket home; it was a waiver. The "Rules" weren't for safety; they were parameters for the experiment. The "Detention" the mannequins spoke of was a permanent stay in a world where students were being turned into black mist for the sake of "science."

The Vice Principal wasn't checking for rule-breakers. He was a caretaker for a harvest.

I didn't wait to find the Chairman. I didn't wait to see if the "End of the World" was a lie or a terrifying reality. I only knew that the air in that building was poisoned by ambition and madness.

## The Waking Dream

I sprinted back down the stairs, my heart drumming a frantic rhythm against my ribs. As I reached the ground floor, I skidded to a halt, bracing myself for the wall of solid gray mist.

But it was gone.

The thick, suffocating vapor had vanished as if it had never existed. The heavy front doors of the school stood wide open, framing the world outside. Without looking back at the clicking mannequins or the glowing screens, I threw myself forward. I sprinted past the threshold, my feet hitting the familiar pavement of the sidewalk.

I didn't stop until I was a block away.

As I slowed to a gasping halt, I felt a subtle, shimmering shift in the air around me. The oppressive weight that had sat on my shoulders since 11:00 PM lifted. I looked up, dreading the sight of a bruised, red sky, but my breath caught in my throat for a different reason.

The moon was a massive, brilliant orb of silver-white, hanging peacefully in a clear indigo sky. There was no crimson glow. There were no reaching shadows. The "Doomsday" news, the "Atomization" manuals, and the bleeding basketball heads felt like images from a fever dream, fading rapidly at the touch of the cool night breeze.

I stood there for a long time, clutching my backpack—the very thing that had lured me back into that nightmare.

I began the long walk home, the streetlamps casting steady, normal shadows at my feet. My mind tried to wrap itself around what had happened, but the details were already slipping away like smoke. Perhaps it was the stress of the exams. Perhaps it was the exhaustion of a long day.

It felt like a dream. A strange, vivid, and terrible nightmare.

But as I reached my front door, I reached into my pocket and felt a piece of paper. My fingers brushed against the crisp, cold edge of the **[School Departure Permit]**.

I didn't pull it out. I didn't want to know if it was real. I simply went inside, locked the door, and left the moonlight behind.
